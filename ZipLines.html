                <h1>zip lines</h1>
                <p>A zip-line, zip line, zip-wire, or flying fox is a pulley suspended on a cable, usually made of stainless steel, mounted on a slope.
                    It is designed to enable cargo or a person propelled by gravity to travel from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable by holding on to, 
                    or being attached to, the freely moving pulley. It has been described as essentially a Tyrolean traverse that engages gravity to assist its speed of movement.
                    Its use is not confined to adventure sport, recreation, or tourism, although modern-day usage tends to favor those meanings.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Ropeways or aerial cables have been used as a method of transport in some mountainous countries for more than 2,000 years, possibly starting in China, India and Japan as early as 250 BC,
                    remaining in use in some remote areas in China such as Nujiang (Salween) valley in Yunnan as late as 2015 before being replaced by bridges.[9] Not all of these structures were assisted by gravity, 
                    so not all fitted the definition of the zip-line. Various technological advances in Europe in the Middle Ages improved the power-line's ropeways, some of which were still assisted by gravity.
                    The first recorded use of the zip-line as a form of entertainment was possibly in 1739, when Robert Cadman, a steeplejack and ropeslider, died when descending from Shrewsbury's St Mary's Church when his rope snapped. 
                    In literature, one appears in The Invisible Man (published 1897) by H. G. Wells as part of a Whit Monday fair and referred to as "an inclined strong".
                    Some sources attribute the development of zip-lines used today as a vacation activity to the Tyrolean traverses developed for mountaineering purposes.
                    In the Australian outback, zip-lines were sometimes used for delivering necessities to people working in or on the other side of a valley, and they may have been used in conflicts by Australian troops to deliver food, mail and even ammunition to forward positions.

                <h2>Current uses</h2>
                <p>
                    As a means of transport Yungas, Bolivia, features a system of zip-lines used for transporting harvested crops, mainly coca, across a valley 200 m below. 
                    They can also be seen in the Ladakh region of India. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the use of aerial ropeways for transporting cargo, 
                    partly due to their low energy requirements and environmental impact. Gravity-fed types, i.e. zip-lines, have been built in Nepal,[15] Latin America and India.
                    Ziplines have also been used as a means of transporting items in Australian regions in the past. These may include ammunition, weapons, tools, food, and mail.
