                <h1>bungee jump</h1>
                <p>Bungee jumping is an activity that involves a person jumping from a great height while connected to a large elastic cord.

                    The launching pad is usually erected on a tall structure such as a building or crane, a bridge across a deep ravine, or on a natural geographic feature such as a cliff. 
                    It is also possible to jump from a type of aircraft that has the ability to hover above the ground, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter. 
                    The thrill comes from the free-falling and the rebound. When the person jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again as the cord recoils, 
                    and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is dissipated.

                    <h2>Early tethered jumping</h2>
                    <p>
                    The land diving of Pentecost Island in Vanuatu is an ancient ritual in which young men jump from tall wooden platforms with vines tied to their ankles as a test of their courage and passage into manhood. 
                    Unlike in modern bungee-jumping, land-divers intentionally hit the ground, but the vines absorb sufficient force to make the impact non-lethal.The land-diving ritual on Pentecost has been claimed as an inspiration by 
                    A.J.Hackett, prompting calls from the islanders' representatives for compensation for what they view as the unauthorised appropriation of their cultural property.
                    A tower 1,200 metres (4,000 ft) high with a system to drop a "car" suspended by a cable of "best rubber" was proposed for the Chicago World Fair, 1892â€“1893. The car, seating two hundred people, 
                    would have been shoved from a platform on the tower and then would have bounced to a stop. The designer engineer suggested that for safety the ground below "be covered with eight feet of feather bedding". 
                    The proposal was declined by the Fair's organizers.

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>
                    The word "bungee" originates from West Country dialect of the English language, meaning "Anything thick and squat", as defined by James Jennings in his book "Observations of Some of the Dialects in The West of England" published 1825.
                    In 1928, the word started to be used for a rubber eraser.The Oxford English Dictionary records early use of the phrase in 1938 relating to launching of gliders using an elasticated cord, and also as "A long nylon-cased rubber band used for securing luggage".
                    "Bungy" is the usual spelling in New Zealand and other countries.
